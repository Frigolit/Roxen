This file lists the known compatibility issues between various
versions of Roxen WebServer.

Between InternetServer 2.4 and Roxen WebServer <= 2.4

 - The font folder has moved from server/nfonts to etc/fonts. The font
   directory setting must be updated in all configurations.

 - The example file folder example_pages has moved from
   server/example_pages to server/etc/example_pages. All example
   servers must have their filesystem module search path updated.

 - The start script no longer adds local/etc/modules to module path,
   local/etc/include to include path and local/etc to program path.
   Use local/pike_modules and local/include instead. Program directory
   is entierly deprecated. A subset of the active include paths are no
   longer added to the internal environment variable representation
   mapping, where it was previously available as PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH.
