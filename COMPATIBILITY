This file lists the known compatibility issues between ChiliMoon 2004
and Roxen WebServer 4.0.

 - The font folder has moved from server/nfonts to data/fonts. The font
   directory setting must be updated in all configurations. This can
   also be solved by adding a symlink.
     ln -s server/data/fonts server/nfonts

 - The example file folder example_pages has moved from
   server/example_pages to server/data/example_pages. All example
   servers must have their filesystem module search path updated. This
   can also be solved by adding a symlink.
     ln -s server/data/example_pages server/example_pages

 - The start script no longer adds local/etc/modules to module path,
   local/etc/include to include path and local/etc to program path.
   Use local/pike_modules and local/include instead. Program directory
   is entierly deprecated. A subset of the active include paths are no
   longer added to the internal environment variable representation
   mapping, where it was previously available as PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH.
   This can also be solved by adding symlinks or by adding the
   following arguments to the start script.
     -M../local/etc/modules
     -I../local/etc/include
     -P../local/etc

 - The etc directory is renamed to data. This affects the settings for
   the content type module and the supports system, both using files
   in that directory. Either all server configurations and the global
   settings have to be updated or a symlink must be added.
     ln -s server/data server/etc

 - The argument cache plugins are now loaded from the directories
   plugins/arg_cache and ../local/plugins/arg_cache. This affects
   users using local argument cache plugins. This can be solved by
   moving or symlinking the old local plugins directory to the new
   location.
     ln -s local/arg_cache_plugins local/plugins/arg_cache

 - The protocol plugins are now loaded from the directories
   plugins/protocols and ../local/plugins/protocols. This affects
   users using local protocol plugins. This can be solved by moving or
   symlinking the old local plugins directory to the new location.
     ln -s local/protocols local/plugins/protocols

 - The Administration interface themes are now loaded from the
   directories server/admin_interface/themes and
   local/admin_interface/themes. This affects users using local themes.
   This can be solved by moving or symlinking the old local themes to
   the new location.
     ln -s local/config_interface/themes local/admin_interface/themes

 - Several /internal-roxen images have been removed. They can be copied
   from a Roxen WebServer installation (server/roxen-images/) to the
   ChiliMoon image directory (server/data/images/) if they are needed.
   The images are:
     power
     power-large-black
     power-large-white
     power-medium-black
     power-medium-white
     power-small-black
     power-small-white
     roxen
     roxen-small
     webserver

 - Less support for running the server without GIF support in Pike.
   There's no technical solution but running Pike with GIF support.

 - The Roxen Built in Unicode font is not included. It was never
   really free, ie. Roxen Internet Software pays money to Bitstream
   Inc. for every downloaded Roxen WebServer. If you need a good font,
   buy one.

 - Special code for Roxen SiteBuilder/Platform/CMS has been removed.
   If you want to run Roxen SiteBuilder/Platform/CMS you'll have to
   stick to Roxen WebServer.

 - Default image format for gtext images is now PNGs with alpha
   channels.  Alter your gtext tags to use format="gif" for the old
   behaviour.

 - You need Pike 7.7, from the CVS, or from the supplied snapshot.

 - The hashing of the seed for the <random> tag has changed so a
   certain seed no longer corresponds to the same random value.

 - The RXML module is no longer a provider module for "modified" and
   "rxmltags".

 - The entity &client.tm; is removed.

 - All special case compatibility with Roxen 1.4 and below has been
   removed. If someone wants Roxen 1.3 compatibility, you're best
   served with Caudium or Roxen 1.3 itself.

 - All subtle Roxen 2.0 till 3.3 changes in RXML variable expansion
   have been scrapped.  We only support 4.0 compatible behaviour.

 - Locales in the admininterface have been dropped.  All interactions with
   the administrator are in English.

 - Support for certain constructs which are part of Roxen 4.0, but
   which were dropped or replaced by others in the ChiliMoon core,
   has been moved to the roxenwebserver compatibility module:

   In the compatibility module:	 	  Should become in ChiliMoon:
    /internal-roxen-			   /*/
    &roxen.;	  			   &system.;
    <combine-path />
    <fsize />				   <emit source=dir />
    <modified />
    <user />
    <\x266a />
    <configimage />			   <img src="/*/..." />
    <crypt />
    <cset />				   <define preparse />
    <sort />

 - Support for <sscanf />, <sprintf /> and <insert href /> has been moved
   to the module rxmltags.pike

 - Support for <expire-time />, <cache />, <nocache /> and <set-max-cache />
   has been moved to the module cache.pike

 - Support for <debug />, <gauge >, <help />, <trace />, <insert variables />,
   <insert scopes />, <if debug /> and <if module-debug />
   has been moved to the module development.pike

 - Support for <if date />, <if time />, <if user />, <if group />,
   <autoformat />, <smallcaps />, and <random />
   has been moved to the module additional_rxml.pike

 - Existing Admin-Interface virtual servers should load two extra modules
   to keep working: "roxenwebserver" and "development"

 - /internal-gopher- generation has moved to the diremit module.

 - roxen-module:// needs to be replaced by chili-module: in inherits

 - Obsolete doOutputTag support dropped from JavaModule and roxenlib
