This file lists the known compatibility issues between ChiliMoon 2004
and Roxen 4.0.

 - You need Pike 7.7, from the CVS, or from the supplied snapshot.

 - The hashing of the seed for the <random> tag has changed so a
   certain seed no longer corresponds to the same random value.

 - The RXML module is no longer a provider module for "modified" and
   "rxmltags".

 - The entity &client.tm; is removed.

 - All special case compatibility with Roxen 1.4 and below has been
   removed. If someone wants Roxen 1.3 compatibility, you're best
   served with Caudium or Roxen 1.3 itself.

 - All subtle Roxen 2.0 till 3.3 changes in RXML variable expansion
   have been scrapped.  We only support 4.0 compatible behaviour.

 - Locales in the admininterface have been dropped.  All interactions with
   the administrator are in English.
