This file lists the known compatibility issues between ChiliMoon 2004
and ChiliMoon 2003.

 - The hashing of the seed for the <random> tag has changed so a
   certain seed no longer corresponds to the same random value.

 - The RXML module is no longer a provider module for "modified" and
   "rxmltags".

 - The entity &client.tm; is removed.
