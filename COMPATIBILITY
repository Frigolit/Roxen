This file lists the known compatibility issues between ChiliMoon 2004
and Roxen 4.0.

 - You need Pike 7.7, from the CVS, or from the supplied snapshot.

 - The hashing of the seed for the <random> tag has changed so a
   certain seed no longer corresponds to the same random value.

 - The RXML module is no longer a provider module for "modified" and
   "rxmltags".

 - The entity &client.tm; is removed.

 - All compatibility modules with Roxen 1.4 have been removed.
   This does not mean that they are removed permanently, but if someone
   wants to have them, be sure to support them.
   Also, in the existing server core, only minor, preferably no patches
   should be required to use the module(s).
   If someone wants Roxen 1.4 compatibility, you're best served with
   Caudium or Roxen 1.4 itself.

 - All subtle Roxen 2.0 till 3.3 changes in RXML variable expansion
   have been scrapped.  We only support 4.0 compatible behaviour.

 - Locales in the admininterface have been dropped.  All interactions with
   the administrator are in English.
