This file lists the known compatibility issues between ChiliMoon 2002
and Roxen WebServer <= 3.3.

 - The font folder has moved from server/nfonts to data/fonts. The font
   directory setting must be updated in all configurations. This can
   also be solved by adding a symlink.
     ln -s server/data/fonts server/nfonts

 - The example file folder example_pages has moved from
   server/example_pages to server/data/example_pages. All example
   servers must have their filesystem module search path updated. This
   can also be solved by adding a symlink.
     ln -s server/data/example_pages server/example_pages

 - The start script no longer adds local/etc/modules to module path,
   local/etc/include to include path and local/etc to program path.
   Use local/pike_modules and local/include instead. Program directory
   is entierly deprecated. A subset of the active include paths are no
   longer added to the internal environment variable representation
   mapping, where it was previously available as PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH.
   This can also be solved by adding symlinks or by adding the
   following arguments to the start script.
     -M../local/etc/modules
     -I../local/etc/include
     -P../local/etc

 - The etc directory is renamed to data. This affects the settings for
   the content type module and the supports system, both using files
   in that directory. Either all server configurations and the global
   settings has to be updated or a symlink must be added.
     ln -s server/data server/etc

 - The argument cache plugins are now loaded from the directories
   plugins/arg_cache and ../local/plugins/arg_cache. This affects
   users using local argument cache plugins. This can be solved by
   moving or symlinking the old local plugins directory to the new
   location.
     ln -s local/arg_cache_plugins local/plugins/arg_cache

 - The protocol plugins are now loaded from the directories
   plugins/protocols and ../local/plugins/protocols. This affects
   users using local protocol plugins. This can be solved by moving or
   symlinking the old local plugins directory to the new location.
     ln -s local/protocols local/plugins/protocols

 - The Administration interface themes are now loaded from the
   directories server/admin_interface/themes and
   local/admin_interface/themes. This affects users usig local themes.
   This can be solved by moving or symlinking the old local themes to
   the new location.
     ln -s local/config_interface/themes local/admin_interface/themes

 - Several /internal-roxen images has been removed. They can be copied
   from a Roxen WebServer installation (server/roxen-images/) to the
   ChiliMoon image directory (server/data/images/) if they are needed.
   The images are:
     power
     power-large-black
     power-large-white
     power-medium-black
     power-medium-white
     power-small-black
     power-small-white
     roxen
     roxen-small
     webserver

 - Less support for running the server without GIF support in Pike.
   There's no technical solution but running Pike with GIF support.

 - The Roxen Built in Unicode font is not included. It was never
   really free, ie. Roxen Internet Software pays money to Bitstream
   Inc. for every downloaded Roxen WebServer. If you need a good font,
   buy one.

 - Special code for Roxen SiteBuilder/Platform/CMS has been removed.
   If you want to run Roxen SiteBuilder/Platform/CMS you'll have to
   stick to Roxen WebServer.
