          Installing Roxen Platform 1.0  - the Binary distribution
          ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  1. Download the binary distribution and place at appropriate place in 
     the file system

  2. Issue the command to unpack the archive:

          .tar.gz:
               If you have GNU tar; "tar xzf Roxen-archive-name"
               If you don't have GNU tar: 
               "gunzip < Roxen-archive-name| tar xf -" 
          .tar
               "tar xf Roxen-archive-name"

     (where "Roxen-archive-name" is the name of the Roxen archive
      file.).

  3. Type "cd <roxen_version>/server" to change to the server directory in
     the new directory.

     (Where roxen_version is the name of the unarchived Roxen directory.)

  4. Start the install script by typing ./install.

  5. Answer the simple questions and wait for your client.

  6. Configure the server, makeing a new virtual server choosing
     "SiteBuilder server" as configuration type.

  7. Set up the necessary variables.

  8. Also, set up a "Manual server" to view the online manuals.

  note:
      You can later on move the <roxen_version> directory to anywhere
     in your filesystem. Roxen does not keep any absolute paths.



 Once you have installed the server, consider joining the Roxen
 mailinglist
