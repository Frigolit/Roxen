Multiple fixes:

  * RXML: <format-number/> now knows about exponents.
    
    Fixes some of a FIXME added at the time of the
    fixes for [bug 4901] and [bug 6055].
    
    Fixes [bug 6903].

  * RXML: Fix multiple formatting problems in <format-number/>.
    
    The formatting of negative numbers was seriously broken if
    no pattern for negative numbers was supplied.
    
    Fixes most of the remaining issues in [bug 6903].

  * RoxenPatch: Added describe_*_patch().
    
    Broke out the inner loops from file_list_*() since they are useful
    to describe single patches as well.

  * RoxenPatch: Added field "file_list" in dry-run mode.
    
    extract_patch() in dry-run mode is useful to examine patches
    without importing them. Unfortunately the information about
    which files that are affected was lost.

  * rxnpatch: list now supports listing unimported patches.
    
    The list command can now be used to examine patch files before import.

  * rxnpatch: Fixed multiple typos in write_list().
    
    The installation date was shown as the uninstallation date for
    uninstalled patches.

  * Ignore unknown tags when parsing HTML.
    
    This should avoid breakage when "<" is encountered in javascripts inlined
    in <script> tags.

  * RXML: Fixed <format-number/> when no fraction in pattern.
    
    Fixes some more of [bug 6903].

  * Added "header-delimiter"-attribute to <insert href>, fixes [bug 6926].

  * RXML: Removed some unused constants in the additional_rxml module.
    
    Fixes some warnings.

  * Support disabling of run-together words per language. Fixes [bug 6890].

  * Fix warnings generated by Pike 8.0.
    
    Note that some of the deprecation warnings have only been suppressed
    in order to be compatible with Pike 7.8. These will have to be fixed
    when the code is officially migrated to Pike 8.0 or later.

  * ABS: List the pending call_outs.
    
    Also clears the alarm when disabling ABS (previously it
    was handled as a spurious trigging).

  * Version bumped to 4.1.34 by distmaker.

  * Don't use HTTP 200 OK when filtering out OS X files since it confuses
    the OS X 10.9 WebDAV client.
