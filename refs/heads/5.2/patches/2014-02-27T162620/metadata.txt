Multiple fixes:

  * RoxenPatch: Fixed some more mode bits.
    
    cp() doesn't copy the mode bits, so we need to adjust them afterwards.
    
    Adds new virtual dependency "roxenpatch/file-modes-2".

  * RoxenPatch: Be more paranoid when copying mode bits.

  * RoxenPatch: Added support for explicit file-modes.
    
    The <new/> and <replace/> metadata tags now support the
    attribute "file-mode", which is a Pike literal expression
    (this means that eg octal notation is supported) containing
    the low order file mode bits.
    
    This feature is needed to support *old* versions of the patch system,
    that threw away file mode bits at import time.
    
    This new feature is available via the feature dependency
    "roxenpatch/file-modes-2".

  * RoxenPatch: Emit file-mode attribute where needed.
    
    Metadata <new/> and <replace/> tags now get the attribute "file-mode"
    set to "0755" for executable files.

  * RoxenPatch: Add automatic feature dependency on "file-modes-2".
    
    When generating metadata files using the attribute "file-mode", also
    add a feature dependency on "file-modes-2".
