Multiple fixes:

  * git-rxnpatch: Fixed init --relative.
    
    The --relative option got lost on first initialization.

  * git-rxnpatch: Support release tags for Pike.

  * git-rxnpatch: Filter testsuite files.

  * RoxenPatch: Improved support for patching Pike:
    
    * Support patching of master.pike.in.
    
    * Remove dumped module files corresponding to patched files.

  * RoxenPatch: Some post processing fixes:
    
    * The post processor always indicated a failure when it had
      actually done something non-trivial.
    
    * Avoid stacking of cflags in the master.pike generator.
    
    * Fix the include_prefix setting in the master.pike generator.

  * RoxenPatch: Fix include directory for generated master.

  * RoxenPatch: Support roxenpatch feature dependencies:
    
    * Adds support for the virtual dependency "roxenpatch/pike-support",
      to ensure that RoxenPatch in use has the proper patch level before
      a pike/lib/* patch is applied.
    
    * git-rxnpatch now automatically adds the above dependency when needed.

NOTE: Roxen needs to be restarted after installing this patch to be
able to install further patches.
