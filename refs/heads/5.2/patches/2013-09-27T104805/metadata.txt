Multiple fixes:

  * Add a font alias name based on the font's ps_name. This is for
    compatibility with Roxen 4.5 which used an older version of
    FreeType where the ps_name was used as family_name for the font,
    while modern FreeType versions use the SFNT family_name (and
    SFNT subfamily_name for style_name).

  * Transform aliased PS font identifiers so that lookup works as expected. Should
    provide sufficient 4.5 compatibility to fix [bug 6872].

  * Fixed an old issue, making the <accessed/> tag a bit more tolerant
    against database connection failures. Bug #6377.
    
    Previously, whole sites could fail and generate backtraces when trying
    to keep access logs if the database connection failed, even for pages
    without <accessed/> tags. Now "catch" has been added at a few places
    to avoid generating backtraces in those cases, and instead some
    limited logging goes to the debug log. However, it's still possible to
    get backtraces when attempting operations such as resetting the access
    log for a page, because it's not clear if it makes sense to make such
    operations fail silently.

  * If slowpipe is used on virtual files that don't implement the
    set_nonblocking() method, it would cause an Internal Server Error.
    Fix: Only call set_nonblocking() if it's supported for the file type.

  * git-rxnpatch: Fixed indent-expansion for new files.
    
    $Id$-strings were not expanded in new files, but were in succeeding
    patches (and dists). This caused succeding patches to fail.
    
    Fixes [bug 6889].

  * git-rxnpatch: Moved git-push to dedicated function.
    
    This makes it easier to test.

  * FSGC: Added API for adding Filesystem Garbage Collectors.
    
    Fixes some of [bug 6572].

  * ConfigInterface: Some code cleanup.
    
    Preparations for adding the FSGC tab.

  * FSGC: First go at a status display.
    
    Adds a new tab "Filesystem GC" under "Global Variables",
    and shows the state of the currently active Filesystem
    Garbage Collectors.
    
    Fixes some more of [bug 6572].

  * git-rxnpatch: Fixed API-miss in git_push().
    
    Fixes bug in previous commit.

  * FSGC: Fixed issue where the fsgc root could be lost.
    
    The filesystem gc now seems to nolonger lose track of the filesystem state.
    
    Fixes some more of [bug 6572].

  * FSGC: Moved API to base_server/module.pike.
    
    This adds registration of modules that register fsgcs.
    
    Note that this API change is incompatible with the previous API.
    This shouldn't be a problem, since nothing that uses the old API
    should be out in the wild yet.

  * ConfigIF: Display the owner of FSGCs.
