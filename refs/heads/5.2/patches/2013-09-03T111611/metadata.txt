Multiple fixes:

  * git-rxnpatch: Fix multiple roxenpatch/pike-support dependencies.
    
    Fixes a bug causing one roxenpatch/pike-support dependency being added
    for every file patched. The bug was due to the intended variable being
    shadowed by another of the same name.

  * git-rxnpatch: First go at supporting delete.
    
    Adds support for deleting the latest patch on the current branch.

  * Vform: Support more characters in <vinput#email/>.
    
    All characters listed in RFC 5322 3.2.3 should now be accepted.
    
    Fixes [bug 6844].

  * RXML: Fix recursive mutex bug.
    
    The tentative fix for [bug 6467] was broken.
    
    Fixes [bug 6866] and some of [bug 6467].
