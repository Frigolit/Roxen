In this directory, files used more or less inderectly by roxen recides.

ssl
+++
 SSL support for roxen. This _requires_ the SSLeay package.
 It expects it to be installed in /usr/local/ssl/. Do make ssl-install
 to enable it if you have the SSL-package installed.
 
 The SSL package can be found at the Roxen FTP site.


shuffle
+++++++
 External datashuffler. Only usable on solaris 2.4 and up. Do make
 shuffle-install to use it. It will speed up the handling of many
 simultaneous connections somewhat.

roxen_hostname
+++++++++++++++
   This program will do the ip to hostname and hostname to ip matching, since
   the programming interface to DNS is blocking. We could ofcourse do
   our own DNS queries, but that seems like too much trouble for too
   little gain.
   
proxygarb
+++++++++
   The Roxen proxy garbage collector. Takes care of cleaning up of
   the proxy cache. (* Needs more work as it is now *)

cgi
+++
   The program used when Roxen is spawning CGI-scripts.

fast_cgi/*
++++++++++
   Slightly rehacked version of the cgi to fast-cgi program
