Changes since Roxen Challenger 1.2 alpha 8
-----------------------------------------------

o When you save port changes in virtual servers (and also the
  configuration ports), you get a page where you are prompted to
  change the virtual server URL (or configuration URL). You can choose
  between the different ports and the current one, which you can also
  modify to something else. This should decrease the number of
  misconfigured server URLs drastically.

o Colors in the configuration interface changed to the official
  Infovav User Interface Colors. Some other changes to the layout as well.

o Changed the name of the 'Error Log' to 'Event Log', since that is a
  more apropriate name. Also fixed it's layout.

o Added a new tag: <pr>. Use <pr help> to get some help.
  Basicaly it just adds an 'Powered By Roxen' logo.


Changes since Roxen Challenger 1.2 alpha 7
-----------------------------------------------

o The SSL3 module now returns a redirect if it is accessed with HTTP.

o CGI security fix.

o Tetris-protocol added.

o Got rid of "Calling function in a destructed object" when SSL3 connections
  are broken.

o Restricted filesystem added. This filesystem restrictes access to
  directories prefixed by the users home-directory. This is usefull for eg
  an FTP-server. Thanks to Zsolt Varga <redax@agria.hu> for the idea.

o SSL3 ports now work without restarting the server.

o Copying configurations now works again.

o privs.pike now clears supplementary group list in case initgroups fails.

o Added kludge for HPUX's broken grouphandling.

o Bugfix for the ftp-module if there aren't any MODULE_FIRST modules.

o configvar can now be started again.

o Single-letter options can now be passed to the start-script.

o Backward-compatibility patch to color.pike.

o Security-levels made a bit less paranoid.

o Logformat fix.

o "New module" button renamed to "Add module".

o Protocol-modules now get the configuration-object as the second argument
  to create().

o Now works again with a threaded pike on Linux.

o CGI problems with SCRIPT_NAME/PATH_INFO hopefully fixed.

o stdin, stdout and stderr can now be specified to spawn_pike().

o activex added to supports-file.

o Added missing parts needed for the mirror-filesystem client/server.
  NOTE: Do NOT generate circular dependencies with mirror-filesystems, or
  there is risk of deadlock.

o The hostredirect-module now handles the case that the host-header isn't
  specified correctly.

o The flik-module now has alt-texts.

o Added support for some more HTTP-proxy-headers.


Changes since Roxen Challenger 1.2 alpha 6
-----------------------------------------------

o New modules: Mirror Filesystem and Mirror Server.  Add a mirror
  server to the server you want to mirror, and a Mirror Filesystem in
  all mirrors. The searchpath of the Mirror Filesystem is used as a
  cache.  It is not a good idea to use the same cache-directory with
  multiple mirror filesystems. There is a mirror for www.roxen.com at
  skuld:2000. The mirror filesystem does not mirror the needed
  modules, though.

o Added option to create FTP servers.

o SSL3 speeded up.

o Reenabled the "Roxen is alive!" output even if DEBUG isn't defined.

o Added option to attempt setting of the RoxenUserID cookie only once.
  Thanks to Francesco 'Kinkie' Chemolli <kinkie@kame.usr.dsi.unimi.it>.

o Added option to disable sym-link following to the normal filesystem.

o Added language modules for Croatian and Slovenian.

o cgi.c now compiles on HPUX again.

o Pike updated to 0.5b9.

o color.pike rgb_to_hsv() fixed for grayscales.

o Module-level security now supports combinations of allow ip and allow user.

o Some patches to the disk-cache.

o Support for several font directories added.

o roxen_hostname now started as root.

o language-modules are now initialized in a safer way.

o privs.pike now contains a default-entry for the root user.

o MIME.decode_base64() now used to decode HTTP-passwords.

o Now gets updates from www.roxen.com instead of from roxen.com.

o Reloading of the "New module" page now only recompiles the modified modules.

o Some fixes to parse_rxml().

o Some fixes to the relay-module.

o Gtext-module now supports scroll.

o Fixed CGI-bug.

o Fixed FTP security bug.

o Added profiling-info to debug-info for developers (requires patch to Pike).

o htaccess now defaults the limit for HEAD to the same as that for GET.


Changes since Roxen Challenger 1.2 alpha 5
-----------------------------------------------

o Fixed the 'default' type in etc/extensions. It should be checked
  now..

o The images in the configuration interface is now cached on
  disk. This seems to speed things up on slow machines, and the images
  will work on HP's where gcc is used...

o Fixed a bug in the .htaccess related to the removal of previously
  loaded .htaccess files.

o Fixed some documentation in the graphics text module

o The hsv colorspace in color.pike has been fixed somewhat, 
  to specify a color in the HSV colorspace, use @H,S,V.
  H is a number between 0 and 360, S anv V are numbers between 0 and
  100 (percent).

o It is now possible to specify colors like 'light neon dark light green'.
  The spaces are quite optional. Possible colormodifiers include
  light, dark and neon.
  
o Added better checks during module-initialization.

o Fixed permission bug in the ftp-module.

o Ftp-module now supports DELE.

o Fixed file_stat() in roxen_master.pike.

o Several MIME-types added.

o Userdatabase module using YP (NIS) added.

o POSIX_SOURCE is now defined during the configure tests.

o The quite meaningless error message
  "This is (probably) the reason: 0" is hopefully gone now.

o Now uses correct permissions when updating the etc/supports file.

o #!NO in modules now seems to work.

o Garbage-collector updated (thanks to Wilhelm Köhler).

o THREADS-mode can now use multiple shuffle-threads (thanks to Wilhelm Köhler).
  To try THREADS (very alpha..) edit etc/include/config.h
  
o Some bugs in the proxies fixed.


Changes since Roxen Challenger 1.2 alpha 4
-----------------------------------------------

o Reenabled the config-interface error-log.

o You can now use path's like /cvs:/roxen_src/server/modules as a module
  directory. Not really all that useful (the modules will be read from 
  CVS automatically, thus ensuring that the latest version is used), but 
  it might be useful for groups of people running concurrent development 
  of roxen modules (like we at infovav..), there is no need to check out 
  the latest version of a module before it can be reloaded in the server.

  the CVSROOT environment variable will be used as the CVS root.

  This was added as an extension to get_dir, stat_file and 
  (program)"string"; (see the etc/roxen_master.pike file)

  So normal pike-scripts can also take advantage of this.

  This is only enabled if CVS_FILESYSTEM is defined.

o The somewhat annoying 'Roxen is alive!' message will no longer be 
  written to the log once per minute unless something else is written
  to the log. It will only be output once if DEBUG isn't defined.

o Root execution of CGI scripts disabled.

o Shuffle disabled for all OS's except Solaris 2.x on sparc.

o Logfiles now opened as root.

o Ftp-module now gives error message instead of sending an error-file.

o .htaccess-module now filters files starting with ".ht".

o Added height specification to module-list images. The module-list should
  now display *much* faster.

o Some patches to disk_cache.pike. It no longer uses FILE objects per 
  default (they cannot be used in non-blocking mode), instead File() 
  objects are used (raw files). Also, the ROXEN_HEAD_SIZE define is not 
  added to headers->headers_size multiple times. Also, the use of 
  file->tell() has been removed, since that function seems to be somewhat 
  broken in FILE (stdio like) objects.

o Some patches for those who are brave enough to run with THREADS enabled.
  Most debug output removed.

o Some new extensions to MIME content-types mappings in the etc/extensions 
  file.

o Applied some patches by Wilhelm Köhler.

o Some patches to language.pike. It no longer uses the value of the LANG 
  environment variable to select the default language. ROXEN_LANG is used 
  instead.

o Replaced all remaining instances of roxen->query with id->conf->query.

o proxy.pike now uses the global shuffle function.

o Cleaned up some of the prestate handling code.
