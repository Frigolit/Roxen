Major changes from Roxen WebServer 2.4:

 - The directory structure has been updated. See COMPATIBILITY
   compatibility issues.
 - The update client is removed.
 - Several major improvements has been made to the Icecast modules.
 - Removed localizations of Administration Interface. There where
   several reasons that lead to this decision:
     - Keeping the localizations synchronized with the latest code
       changes is a big and never ending job, which only Kai Voigt has
       managed to be good enough for when it comes to the german
       locale.
     - No matter how good the translators are, there will almost
       certainly be parts that has not been translated.
     - Most people use the english locale anyway, which not only is
       the most up to date, but also provides a vocabulary that makes
       it possible to read/write docmentation, report understandable
       bugs and in general communicate with others.
     - Localized code looks horrible and adds a lot of extra work to
       development. That's ok for paid development, but...
     - We will save memory and gain speed.

 New modules:
   - CVS Repository file system; can mount a CVS repository.
   - Icecast ID3 tag emit plugin; shows ID3 (1.0, 1.1, 2.2.x, 2.3.x,
     2.4.x) information about MP3 files.
