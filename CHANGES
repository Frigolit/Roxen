o Following the wishes expressed on the list Roxen is moving to clean
  out the directory structure. Some notes on this:
 
 + Almost everything is shadowed from ../local. e.g. config_interface,
   supports, extensions, languages, roxen-images and so on checks
   ../local first.

 + ../var/ is added and is used to store caches and the like.

 + The configdir now only stores settings. No caches.

 + There are some new functions in Roxen to handle this, but that goes
   outside the scope of this letter. Will post in separate letter.

 + This is not complete yet.
