-----------------------------------------------

o Added German translation by Kai Voigt.  Thanks Kai!

o Fixed installation of cvs in Platform.

o Following the wishes expressed on the list Roxen is moving to clean
  out the directory structure. Some notes on this:
 
 + Almost everything is shadowed from ../local. e.g. config_interface,
   supports, extensions, languages, roxen-images and so on checks
   ../local first.

 + ../var/ is added and is used to store caches and the like.

 + The configdir now only stores settings. No caches.

 + There are some new functions in Roxen to handle this, but that goes
   outside the scope of this letter. Will post in separate letter.

 + This is not complete yet.

o Disabled sendfile(2) on FreeBSD 4.0.16 and earlier.

o Added SANE (scanner interface) support to Pike.

o Added Gnome support to Pike.

o Added Gtk+Extra support to Pike.

o Fixed problem with dumped sitebuilders. (kludge: don't dump.)

o Improved language support in SiteBuilder.

o Lots of bugs fixed.
