Major changes from Roxen WebServer 3.3:

 - The directory structure has been updated. See COMPATIBILITY
   compatibility issues.
 - The update client is removed.
 - Several major improvements has been made to the Icecast modules.
 - HTTP and HTTPS protocol modules are rewritten to use the direct
   memory access functionality in the Shuffler Pike module.
 - Optimized for Pike 7.3 which means better performance and better
   looking source code.
 - Removed localizations of Administration Interface. There where
   several reasons that lead to this decision:
     - Keeping the localizations synchronized with the latest code
       changes is a big and never ending job, which only Kai Voigt has
       managed to be good enough for when it comes to the german
       locale.
     - No matter how good the translators are, there will almost
       certainly be parts that has not been translated.
     - Most people use the english locale anyway, which not only is
       the most up to date, but also provides a vocabulary that makes
       it possible to read/write docmentation, report understandable
       bugs and in general communicate with others.
     - Localized code looks horrible and adds a lot of extra work to
       development. That's ok for paid development, but...
     - We will save memory and gain speed.
 - Removed support for licenses. While it would have been good to have
   a licensing system, to attract commercial entities in the future,
   there is really not much of a point in an open source product.
   Remember that the first pirated version of Roxen SiteBuilder appeard
   in warez archives just _after_ the license system was added.
 - No more documentation in the administration interface. We don't
   have any redistribution rights for Roxens manuals.
 - Lots of minor bugs has been fixed, and some has been introduced.
 - Improved easter eggs.

 New modules:
   - CVS Repository file system; can mount a CVS repository.
   - Icecast ID3 tag emit plugin; shows ID3 (1.0, 1.1, 2.2.x, 2.3.x,
     2.4.x) information about MP3 files.
