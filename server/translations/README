Roxen translations
------------------

These files contain the locale/translation system with XML-based
language files introduced in Roxen 2.1. The strings are extracted from
the source and kept coherent by a tool included in Pike 7.1. 

Files for each language is in a directory with the language code from
the ISO-639-2 standard (http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/). The
files in the directory correspond to certain parts or activites in
Roxen.

Each file is loaded and cached on demand. The status of this can be
checked in the administration interface under Tasks, Status, Cache status.


*) How to a add new translation 
Create a directory with the proper language code and copy the files from
the 'eng'-directory into the new one. These files are empty and ready for
new translations. After the personal option 'Show all translations' is
enabled in the administration interface, it should be possible to select
the new translation by the flag in the upper right corner, no matter how
empty it is (the default English text will then be the fallback).


*) File structure 
Information for each string that should be translated is kept within a 
<str id="foo">...</str> container. The id is unique for a certain string.

The original string (like in the source) is kept inside the
<str>-container inside a <o>...</o>. Do not change this - it is used to
detected if the original string has changed since the translation was
done.

The translation is written within a <t>...</t>-container.

Additionaly, there can be <new/>-markers (useful for searching for
untranslated strings), and <changed from="...">-tags (if the original
string has changed so a translator can verify that the translation still
is correct).


*) Improving translations
One way is to browse through the translation files, searching for
<new/> or <changed/> markers and dealing with these.

Another way is to feed Roxen's start-script with the parameter
'-DLOCALE_DEBUG', which makes the translationsystem a little more
talkative. All strings then get their id appended which makes them easy to
spot.


Any patches or new translation are of course welcome for inclusion in the
Roxen distribution.
