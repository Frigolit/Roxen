<h2><i>Welcome to Roxen Challenger!</i></h2>

<p>

If this is the first time you use Roxen, I suggest that you take a
look at the <a href=http://roxen.com/configuration/>configuration help
page</a>, preferably in another window. Read about the example
configuration session there, before you configure this server.

<p>The first thing you will have to do is to set a user name and
password. These will get you into the configuration interface when you
want to configure the server later on.

<p>You might also want to specify an IP-pattern. Then you may only
configure the server from hosts whose IP-number match the pattern.

<p>If you have any questions or problems, first look at <a
href=http://roxen.com/faq.html>the incomplete FAQ</a>, then
check <a href=http://roxen.com/archive.lpc>the mailing list
archive</a> (which is also <a
href=http://roxen.com/search/>searchable</a>). You should
also read the online documentation, of course. If you still have a
problem, just send a mail to <a href=mailto:roxen@infovav.se>the
Roxen mailinglist</a> and ask. You will be autosubscribed.
