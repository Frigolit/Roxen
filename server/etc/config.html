<h1><font size=+2>
<br><b>Welcome to the configuration interface of Roxen Challenger.</b>
</font></h1>
<p>

At the top of the page there are four other buttons.
Pressing one of them will select that section of the configuation
interface. Pressing the <em>selected</em> button will focus that part
of the configuration interface on the top node of that part of the
interface.  <p> It will probably make sense once you try it.  <p>

<p>

There are usually one or more buttons at the bottom of the page, to do
things that does not fit nicely in the 'node with subnodes'
methaphore, like adding a new virtual server, unfolding/folding more
than one node at the time etc, at the top or bottom of the
configuration interface.

<p>

Some buttons, like the 'add a new module' button are only available in
certain nodes (a node of a certain type has been focused).
