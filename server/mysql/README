This is where the Mysql installation should be located.

If you already have a Mysql, you can symlink it to this directory.

As an example, lets pretend that a mysql is installed in /usr/local,
and the mysqld server binary is located in the 'libexec' directory.

To set up roxen to use this mysql, run these commands:

ln -s /i/usr/local/libexec .
ln -s /i/usr/local/share .

Sometimes the mysqld binary recides in sbin or bin instead, if so,
modify the first ln command to link that directory instead.

A binary tar.gz-type MySQL distribution can be installed directly into
this directory.
