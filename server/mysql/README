This is where the Mysql binary should be located.
If you already have a Mysql, you can symlink it to this directory.

As an example, lets pretend that a mysql is installed in
/i/mysql/default.

Type "ln -s /i/mysql/default/* mysql/" in the server directory to use
it.

An alternative is to install a release into this directory.
