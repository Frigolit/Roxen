This is where the MySQL installation should be located.

If you already have a MySQL, you can symlink it to this directory.

As an example, if MySQL is installed in /usr/local and the mysqld
server binary is located in the 'libexec' directory, run these
commands to set up Roxen:

  ln -s /usr/local/libexec .
  ln -s /usr/local/share .

Sometimes the mysqld binary resides in sbin or bin instead. If so,
modify the first 'ln' command to link that directory.

If you don't have a MySQL server installed you can get it from
<http://www.mysql.com/>. A binary tar.gz-type MySQL distribution can
be installed directly into this directory.

Roxen currently requires at least version 3.23.49 of MySQL.
