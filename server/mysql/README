This is where the Mysql installation should be located.

If you already have a Mysql, you can symlink it to this directory.

As an example, lets pretend that a mysql is installed in /usr/local,
and the mysqld server binary is located in the 'libexec' directory.

To set up roxen to use this mysql, run these commands:

ln -s /usr/local/libexec .
ln -s /usr/local/share .

Sometimes the mysqld binary recides in sbin or bin instead, if so,
modify the first ln command to link that directory instead.

If you don't have a Mysql server installed, you can get it from:
http://www.mysql.com/

Roxen currently requires at least version 2.23.49 MySQL.

A binary tar.gz-type MySQL distribution can be installed directly into
this directory.
