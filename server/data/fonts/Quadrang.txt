I've provided the world with over a hundred and twenty five free fonts,
so if you'd like to make a donation I'd be more than happy to accept it.

No donation is too small!  Music and artwork are good too.
If you have some CD's you're not listening to anymore, send 'em along!

Send anything at all to

If you decide to send a cheque (that's how we spell it in Canada)
make it payable to Ray Larabie.  If you want to double check the address

Canadian or US funds?  Any funds are fine with me.
Whatever's easy for you.
