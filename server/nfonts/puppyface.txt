"This type was made by Claus Kristensen for an interactive
 story on the internet called "Puppetface" which is still in the
 making.. You control the life of the Puppetface. . .you are
 the voices inside his head and therefore his future relies
 on you mind. . . We are two graphic designers who will
 illustrate the story as it goes along using a variety of media to
 express his twisted mind."
