 If your fonts are way to large (or small, depending on personal
 preferences), please adjust the unicode font size in your
 browser. This configuration interface uses UTF-8, and at least
 netscape has a different font size for unicode fonts (defaulting to 18)
 than normal fonts (defaulting to 12).
