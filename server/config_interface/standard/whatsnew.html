The Java Servlet interface has been updated to be compliant with the
latest specification.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name="New administration interface">
 There is, as you have probably noted, a brand new configuration
 interface in roxen 2.0. It supports multiple users, multiple
 languages, and themes.
<p>
 The event log has been enhanced as well, and now includes information
 about which module in which configuration generated the message.
 There are also configuration and module local event logs.
</p>
<p>
 The administration interface is written mostly in RXML, and can be
 found in the 'configuration_interface' directory in your roxen
 installation.

<new-feature name="PHP4 / Zend">

<new-feature name="Bandwidth Throttling and fast HTTP">
  The normal HTTP module can now throttle the bandwidth, both for
  requests and per virtual server.
<p>
  There is also an alternative HTTP module (called 'fhttp') that
  provides the maximum possible performance, mostly useful for
  <em>very</em> busy sites, or benchmarking. Speeds of over 20.000
  requests/second has been clocked on normal x86 hardware.<p>
  The normal HTTP protocol module has also been performance tuned, and
  is now approximately 10% faster than before.</p>
