<new-feature name="Java module interface">
It is now possible to write Roxen-modules in Java.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name="New configuration interface">
 There is, as you have probably noted, a brand new configuration
 interface in roxen 2.0. It suppors multiple users and multiple
 languages.
<p>

 The event log has also been enhanced, and now includes information
 about which module in which configuration generated the
 message. There are also configuration and module local event logs.

<p>

  The configuration interface is also written mostly in RXML, and can be
  found in the 'configuration_interface' directory in your roxen
  installation.
