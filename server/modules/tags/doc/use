<dd>Read all macros and tag/container definitions from the file 'file'.

<p> This file will be fetched just as if someone had tried to fetch it
    with an HTTP request. This makes it possible to use Pike script

<p> results and other dynamic documents. <b>But:</b> beware: The
    results of the parsing is heavily cached for performance reasons,
    if you do not want this cache use <nobr><kbd>{insert
    file=... nocache}</kbd></nobr> insead of <nobr><kbd>{use
    file=...}</kbd></nobr>.  
</dl>

<p>

The primary use of this tag is for site-wide tags and containers. It
is much faster to use {use} than {include} when defining tags and
macros, since the parsed definitions is cached rather than the
contents of the file
