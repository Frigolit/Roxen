{aconf href=... [+config -config ...]}:


 Adds or removes a config option. Config options are simple toggles,
and are always server-global but client-local. If the server supports
cookies, they are placed in the 'roxen-config' cookie, otherwise they
are added as prestate variables. Use {if config=...} to test for
the presence of a prestate.. {aconf} works just like the {a
href=...} container, but if no 'href' attribute is specified, the
current page is used.
