<kbd>{redirect [to=...] [text=...] [+state -state ...]}</kbd>

<p>Adds an HTTP redirect header and return code.

<p>Arguments prefixed with '+' or '-' are treated as prestate toggles,
which are added or removed, respectively, from the current set of
prestates in the URL in the redirect header (see also {apre}). Note
that this only works when the to=... URL is absolute, i.e. begins with
a '/', otherwise these state toggles have no effect.
