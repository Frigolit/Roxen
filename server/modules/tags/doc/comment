<kbd><b>{comment}text{/comment}</b></kbd>

<p>The enclosed text will be removed from the document. The difference
from a normal SGML comment is that the text is removed from the
document, and can not be seen even with view source. Another
difference is that any RXML tags inside this container will _not_ be
parsed.
