<h2>Creating HTML pages</h2>

The creation and handling of files is done in the HTML editor
described above. There are a few aspects unique to AutoSite that
should be considered when creating the HTML pages.


<h3>The &lt;search&gt; Tag</h3>

When the IntraSeek module is enabled for a site, the &lt;search&gt;
tag can be used in the content files to add a search tool on the page.
Simply put the &lt;search&gt; tag in the HTML/RXML code where you want
the search form to appear on your page.

<p>The search tool will allow a visitor to search the content of the
pages on the site.


<h3>&lt;forms-mail&gt;...&lt;/forms-mail&gt;</h3>

<tt>&lt;forms-mail&gt;</tt>


<h4>Attributes:</h4>
<pre>      to:    receiver of the mailed form
      from:  sender address (must exist)</pre>


<h4>Contents:</h4>

<p>A check-box (on/off):
<pre>  &lt;input type=checkbox name=mycheckbox&gt;</pre>

<p>A set of radio buttons:
<pre>  &lt;input type=radio name=myradiobutton value=green&gt;
  &lt;input type=radio name=myradiobutton value=blue&gt;</pre>

<p>A select-box:
<pre>  &lt;input type=select name=myselect&gt;
    &lt;option value="volvo"&gt;Volvo&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="saab"&gt;Saab&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="Toyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/input&gt;</pre>

<p>A one-line input area:
<pre>  &lt;input type=text name=mystring size=40&gt;</pre>

<p>A multiple-line text input area:
<pre>  &lt;textarea rows=10 cols=70 name=mytextarea&gt;</pre>


<h4>Example:</h4>

<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Send us some feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;forms-mail from=feedback@mydomain.com to=feedback@mydomain.com&gt;
Your name: &lt;input type=text size=40 name=name&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Your e-mail: input type=text size=40 name=name&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Your sex: &lt;input type=radio name=sex value="male"&gt; Male
&lt;br&gt;          &lt;input type=radio name=sex value="female"&gt; Female
&lt;br&gt;Your thoughts about us:
&lt;textarea rows=20 cols=65 name=thoughts&gt;I think...&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;/forms-mail&gt;</pre>


<h3>Gtext Headings</h3>

The large headings, &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
used in the content files on the site will be shown as gtext, making
them widely configurable and nice looking. Since gtext is shown as gif
images extensive use of gtext headings can make a page slow to load.


<h3>Special files</h3>

A new site will contain three files in the root or /-directory,
<i>index.html, footer.html</i> and <i>logo.gif</i>. Index.html is of
course the home page but the other two perhaps need some further
explanation.


<h4>/footer.html</h4>

The contents of this file will be included on the bottom of all pages
on the site who use the template. When the site is created the file is
empty. The footer align can be changed in the template editor.


<h4>/logo.gif</h4>

This file will be included on all pages on the site who use the
template. When the site is created the image is a very small,
transparent image. Since it is transparent it will be virtually
invisible.

<p>This file can be replaced with, for instance, the company logo or
any other GIF-image. To replace the image first remove the old
<i>logo.gif</i>-file and then upload the new image or move/rename an
existing GIF-file.


<h2>AutoMail</h2>

Roxen Mail is a complete mail system with a mail server, for this
system the server is <i>tifa.idonex.se</i>, and a web based mail
client, Roxen WebMail.


<h3>Different Protocols</h3>

There are a few different protocols used when fetching mail from a
server using different methods of fetching and storing the mail. This
system supports the two currently most popular protocols, POP and
IMAP, and also provides its own web based mail client.

<p>POP: Clients using POP copies the mail to the local file system.
Most clients can be configured to leave a copy on the server, but when
reading the mail with another client or from another computer the old
mails will be shown as unread.

<p>IMAP: The IMAP protocol stores the mail on the mail server which
means that the information about mail that has been read etc is
available using any IMAP client connecting to the server.

<p>WebMail: Roxen WebMail is a web based mail client that can be used
from your web browser without installing additional software.

<br>Note: The client does not use a mail tool built in to your browser
but is complete in itself.


<h3>Choosing server</h3>


<h4>POP:</h4>

If you read mail with a client using POP, choose <i>tifa.idonex.se</i>
as POP server.


<h4>IMAP:</h4>

If you read mail with a client using IMAP, choose
<i>tifa.idonex.se</i> as IMAP server.


<h2>Roxen WebMail</h2>

The Roxen WebMail client is found by adding <i>/mail/</i> to the
domain URL of the site in your browser, like this:
<tt>http://www.<i>domainname</i>/mail/</tt>

<p>When asked for a username and a password, type

<pre>    <i>username*domainname</i></pre>

as a username. The username and password can only be changed on
<tt>http://www.<i>domainname</i>/webadm/</tt> by the site
administrator.
