                                      Nautilus symbolises all the qualities of innovation, dedication and love of music
                                      which have inspired B&W engineers, designers and production teams ever since our
                                      company was established over 30 years ago. The Nautilus offers a unique chance to
                                      hear music exactly as recorded - detailed, vibrantly alive, full of power and
                                      unhindered by speaker distortion or cabinet diffraction. Our research teams
                                      dedicated much of their creative effort to eliminating distortion in all its
                                      various forms. The Nautilus has therefore become the first in the world to achieve
                                      near zero cabinet colouration.

                                         Each Nautilus loudspeaker has its own dedicated active crossover unit connected
                                         to appropriate pre and power amplifiers. The networks include components which
                                         have been hand-made and individually fine-tuned to modify driver performance to
                                         suit listening room requirements. Because B&W crossover's are carefully matched
                                         to each drive unit, both driver and network can be updated to keep pace with
                                         new refinements.

<img src=series4.jpg align=right>In a attempt to get rid of unwanted resonance around tweeters and mid-range
                                     drivers, B&W engineers have pioneered the use of a rare earth magnet. The magnets
                                     are made from neodymium, iron and boron and are extremely powerful. Hollowing out
                                     the pole piece creates space for rearward-travelling sound waves to pass through
                                     the magnet. The combination of an acoustically transparent magnet and the
                                     horn-shaped transmission-line pipes absorbs virtually all rearward radiation of
                                     sound - creating the nearest thing yet to an infinite baffle.
